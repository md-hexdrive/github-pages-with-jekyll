# Welcome to my blog

Hello, my name is Micah Dotzert, and this is my personal blog.
I'm glad you are here. In this blog I plan to discuss all the projects I have worked on (or am currently working on).

## Battlesnake
I created a Battlesnake to compete in the "Battlsnake at Communitech" and the "Battlesnake Summer League".

## Self-Driving Car
Together with my brother, we built a Self-Driving Car based on a Raspberry Pi Model 3B. The car uses Computer Vision with Tensorflow and OpenCV to autonomously drive itself around an arbitrary track. The car's AI is trained with data collected by driving it manually. The training itself occurs in Google Colab.

This car was created as my final project in COMP 444: Embedded/Robotic Programming at Athabasca University.

## Windows Spotlight Photo Copier
An Python script that automatically copies the photos that Windows Spotlight downloads to display on the Windows 10 lock screen to a folder on the user's desktop.
